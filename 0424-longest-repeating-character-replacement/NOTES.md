We'll basically map letters to their frequency as we encounter them. Then, we'll check if window length - maximum_frequency is less than k (letters that are a minority in the window). If it is less than or equal to k, it means that the substring is valid and we'll keep a track of its length; else shift left pointer.


To recognize problems where this approach can be used, look for the following characteristics:
1)Optimization using Sliding Window: Problems that involve optimizing or finding a maximum/minimum length of a substring, subarray, or subsequence often benefit from the sliding window technique.
2)Validity Conditions: Problems that have conditions for the validity of the window or substring. These conditions often involve some measure of character frequency, sum, or difference within the window.
3)Changing Elements in the Window: Problems where you can change or modify elements within the window to meet certain requirements, such as making characters the same, maximizing certain counts, etc.
By recognizing these characteristics in problems, you can build your intuition for applying the sliding window technique and efficiently solve a wide range of problems.
