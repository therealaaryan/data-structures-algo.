Set two pointers; l and r at two extreme ends and keep a track of the maximum area. Keep shifting the pointer that is less than the other.


Intuition:- When searching for a specific pair of elements in an array that adds up to a target value, you can use the two-pointer technique, where one pointer starts from the beginning and the other from the end of the array. This method works well when the array is sorted and you're looking for a specific pair.â€‹
