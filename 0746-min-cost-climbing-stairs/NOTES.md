The top of the stairs isn't mentioned in the cost array. So append 0 to the array (0 for the 0 cost at the top)â€‹. We will store the minimum cost required at a step to reach the top at cost[i] as cost[i] = min(cost[i] + cost[i + 1], cost[i] + cost[i + 2]). To already have the cost at upper stairs, we'll iterate cot in a reverse order. Finally, return minimum of cost[0] and cost[1].


Here are some tips and tricks to recognize when reverse order iteration might be useful in dynamic programming problems:

1)Dependency on Future States: If the value of the current state depends on the values of future states, it's a clue that reverse iteration might be needed. In the case of climbing stairs, the cost of reaching the current step depends on the cost of reaching the next two steps.
2)Optimal Substructure Property: Dynamic programming problems often exhibit the optimal substructure property, meaning that an optimal solution to the problem can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems. In such cases, working from the end towards the beginning helps in utilizing the solutions of subproblems.
3)Transition Function: Look at the recurrence relation or the transition function that relates the current state to future states. If the recurrence involves future states, it's a sign that you might need to iterate in reverse.
4)Bottom-Up Approach: When using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, it's common to start from the base case and iteratively build up to the final solution. In some cases, this involves iterating in reverse order.
5)Memory Optimization: Sometimes, reverse iteration is used to optimize memory usage. In your example, instead of storing the minimum cost for each step in a separate array, the algorithm updates the existing cost array.
