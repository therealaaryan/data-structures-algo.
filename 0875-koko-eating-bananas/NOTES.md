We'll use binary search for this. Set 1 as minimum (as that is the minimum amount of bananas koko can eat) and the max of piles as maximum. Run binary search and check if the mid value is the minimum you've encountered yet.â€‹


Recognizing when to use binary search can be a valuable skill in problem-solving. While it may not always be immediately apparent, there are certain characteristics and patterns in problems that indicate binary search could be an effective approach. Here are some signs to look for:

Sorted Data: Binary search is most effective when the data is sorted in some way. If the problem involves sorted arrays, intervals, or ranges, there's a good chance binary search could be useful.

Search Space Reduction: If the problem requires you to search for a specific value, target, or condition within a large range of possibilities, binary search can help quickly narrow down the search space.

Optimization or Decision Problems: Binary search is often used in optimization problems where you need to find the best solution that meets a certain condition (e.g., maximizing or minimizing). It's also useful in decision problems where you need to determine whether a condition is met or not.

Monotonicity: If the problem exhibits a "monotonic" property, where a certain condition changes consistently (e.g., increasing or decreasing), binary search can be effective. This is often seen in problems with a clear pattern or trend.

Divide and Conquer: Binary search follows a divide-and-conquer approach. If the problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems and combined to find the solution, binary search could be a candidate.

Time Complexity Consideration: If the problem's time complexity is a concern and you're aiming for a more efficient solution than linear search, binary search might be a suitable alternative.

Threshold or Boundary Problems: Problems that involve finding a threshold or boundary point (e.g., first occurrence, last occurrence) can often be solved using binary search.

Biased Partitioning: If the problem requires you to repeatedly divide the data into two parts with a specific bias (e.g., search in one direction until a condition is met), binary search can be helpful.

Alternate Approaches Seem Complex: Sometimes, when alternative approaches seem complex or inefficient, binary search can offer a simpler and more elegant solution.

Tags and Problem Context: As you mentioned, paying attention to problem tags and context can be helpful. If binary search is mentioned or the problem is tagged with terms like "binary search," "searching," or "optimization," it's a strong indication that binary search should be considered.
