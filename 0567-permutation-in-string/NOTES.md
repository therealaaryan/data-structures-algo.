Keep a list of 26 length for both arrays for hash table. Initialize matches once by iterating and seeing if all 26 characters match. With every silde of the window, change the matches accordingly and if matches is equal to 26, return true.â€‹


To recognize when a similar approach with the matches variable could be used, look for the following characteristics in the problem:
1)Sliding Window: Problems where you need to consider a window or substring of fixed length within a larger string or array.
2)Matching Character Counts: Problems where you need to check if the character counts (or some other frequencies) in two windows or arrays are the same or satisfy certain conditions.
3)Character Frequency Manipulation: Problems that involve tracking and manipulating character frequencies, especially when dealing with permutations, anagrams, or substrings.
4)Efficient Comparison: Situations where comparing the entire arrays at each step may be computationally expensive or unnecessary. Using a measure like the matches variable can improve efficiency.
