We'll use a hashmap in the constructor that'll store the key as the key and list of [value, timestamp] associated with a particular key as value. Set is straight-forward appending to the hashmap. For get, we'll use a binary search because the question says that the timestamp is strictly increasing. We'll set the value list associated with the given key as our list, set l and r pointers. Since we can return the value at that timestamp or the value of the timestamp closest to the given timestamp but less than it, while l <= r, if the timestamp is <= given timestamp, we'll set the value as ans and move the left pointer, else we'll only move the right pointer without setting the value as ans. Finally, return ans.â€‹
