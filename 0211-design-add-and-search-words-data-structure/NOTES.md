We will implement the trie as it and add words the way we used to. For searching, we will use backtracking because the dots mean that all children of a node can be explored.


Here are some hints and scenarios where you should consider using tries:

1) Prefix Matching: Tries are excellent for prefix matching problems, where you need to find all words with a given prefix efficiently. For example, implementing an autocomplete feature in a search bar.

2)Pattern Matching: When you need to search for words or patterns that match a given pattern, where "." can be used as a wildcard character (as in your example), tries are a great choice. They allow you to perform wildcard pattern matching efficiently.

3)Dictionary Implementations: Tries can be used to implement dictionaries or word databases efficiently. You can add words to the trie and search for them quickly.

4)Spell Checkers: Tries are commonly used in spell checkers to suggest corrections or validate the spelling of words.

5)Longest Common Prefix: When you need to find the longest common prefix among a set of words, tries can help you do this efficiently.

6)Word Games: Tries can be used in word games like Scrabble or Boggle to validate if a given word is valid or find all valid words on a game board.

7)IP Routing: Tries are also used in networking for IP address routing, where each node in the trie represents a part of the IP address.â€‹
