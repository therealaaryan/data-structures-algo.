We'll use a hashmap. In this, the key will be the count list, that will have 26 0s initially and for every letter in a word, the corressponding index will be appended by 1 in count. The values of the hashmap will be the list of words that have the same count. Use defaultdict for hashmap and set the key count as tuple since lists cannot be key in dictionary.


To recognize problems that might have a similar approach, look for the following patterns:
1) Invariant Properties: Problems where an invariant property remains the same for elements that need to be grouped together. In the case of anagrams, it's the character count, but for other problems, it could be the frequency of elements, bitwise representations, etc.
2) Hashing for Grouping: Problems where grouping elements based on some characteristic can be efficiently done using hashmaps. This typically involves converting the characteristic to a suitable hashable format like a tuple, array, or string.
3) Anagram-Like Situations: Problems where you need to find elements that are "similar" based on certain rules or properties, even if they are not strictly anagrams. In such cases, recognizing the property that defines the similarity is crucial.
