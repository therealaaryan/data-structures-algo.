Sort the array and fix one element, then run two sum 2 for the remaining 2 elements. Skip the element if it is equal to it's previous element.


You should look for situations where you need to avoid duplicates while processing or combining elements. This often arises when you have sorted or preprocessed the data and need to handle multiple occurrences of the same value in a controlled manner.
In general, whenever you encounter a situation where there's a need to filter or control elements in some way, consider using obscure test cases and test for edge cases to handle duplicates and ensure the uniqueness of the final result.
